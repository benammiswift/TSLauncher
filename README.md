# TSLauncher

A free launcher for Dovetail Games Train Simulator which provides a
graphical user interface for common launch options used in TS.

These can then be used to launch either 32 bit/ 64 bit or DX12 versions.

Tutorial:

1 - Put the launcher anywhere.
2 - Run the launcher AS ADMINISTRATOR (It wont work properly without)
3 - Tick the boxes you wish to use
3.5 - There's more options for developers which appear when pressing the "developer options" button. Best part is, if you enable this, it'll be remembered next time and open automatically
4 - If you want to use an FPS Limit or Set LogMate filters in the Developer options, just fill in the text fields and these will be handled automagically.
5 - Press which version of TS you wish to launch and hey presto, it should launch

Report any bugs on here or anywhere else I frequent.
Do the same if you want any other launch options adding
